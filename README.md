A simple web project to interact with the Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis APIs.

## Notes

Using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API), the computer can hear or read text aloud.

The `SpeechSynthesis` interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the speech service; this can be used to retrieve information about the synthesis voices available on the device, start and pause speech, and other commands besides.
