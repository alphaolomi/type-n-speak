# Type-N-Speak

A simple web project to interact with the Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis^1 APIs.



Using the [Web_Speech_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/), the computer can hear or read text aloud.

The SpeechSynthesis interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the speech service; this can be used to retrieve information about the synthesis voices available on the device, start and pause speech, and other commands besides.
